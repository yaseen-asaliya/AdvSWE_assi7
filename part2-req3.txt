part 1:
Briefly, I expected errors to occur in the release and send functions,and I created
a special Exception in every error that could happen, and I made a handling for each
of these Exceptions, and then I used Try-Catch in the Demo Class to use each of the 
Exceptions that I made when There is a reason to summon it.

part 2:
I put each logger in a suitable place for it, for example, I put the Error Logger in
the catch because when this catch is called, there will be an error that has occurred,
the warning logger when a specific protocol is deleted to alert the user that there is
a deletion, the info logger when a comparison process is being searched for example,
and the debug logger when Define protocols.
