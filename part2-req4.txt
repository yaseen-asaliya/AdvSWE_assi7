why the logger uses a singleton design pattern ?

Logging is a fundamental part of applications Logs can inform us of many
 useful things such as; errors, warnings, stack traces, order of operations,
 events, etc ,with this information , we are able to find, and therefore resolve
 bugs more quickly, and ensure our applications are running correctly and logs
 can be stored to many storage devices, such as slack channels and server logs,
 making them more accessible to us.
